                    <p class="mb-4">A shopping app is a mobile application that enables users to browse, search, and purchase products or services conveniently from their devices. It typically offers features like product listings, shopping cart, secure payment options, and order tracking, providing a seamless shopping experience for customers. Shopping apps often provide personalized recommendations, promotions, and user reviews to enhance the overall shopping process.

                                              By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                                              automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                                              that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                                              allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                                              our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                                              extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                                              to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
                                              versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,

                                            </p> <p>
                                              Mr.Programmer is committed to ensuring that the app is
                                              as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                                              reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                                              its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                                              charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                                              clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                                            </p> <p>
                                              The Mr.Shop app stores and processes personal data that
                                              you have provided to us, to provide my
                                              Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                                              access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                                              not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                                              removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                                              official operating system of your device. It could make your
                                              phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                                              compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                                              that the Mr.Shop app won’t work properly or at all.

                                              You should be aware that there are certain things that
                                              Mr.Programmer will not take responsibility for. Certain
                                              functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                                              internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
                                              by your mobile network provider, but Mr.Programmer
                                              cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                                              functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                                              have any of your data allowance left.
                                            </p> <p></p> <p>
                                              If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                                              should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
                                              mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                                              be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                                              the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                                              other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                                              responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                                              charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                                              (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                                              you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                                              using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                                              received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                                            </p> <p>
                                              Along the same lines, Mr.Programmer cannot always take
                                              responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                                              make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                                              battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                                              Mr.Programmer cannot accept responsibility.
                                            </p> <p>
                                              With respect to Mr.Programmer’s responsibility for your
                                              use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                                              bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                                              updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                                              to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                                              to you. Mr.Programmer accepts no liability for any
                                              loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                                              relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                                            </p> <p>
                                              At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                                              currently available on Android – the requirements for the 
                                              system(and for any additional systems we
                                              decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                                              and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                                              using the app. Mr.Programmer does not promise that it
                                              will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                                              and/or works with the Android version that you have
                                              installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                                              accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                                              also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                                              it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                                              Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                                              rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                                              (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                                              from your device.
                                            </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
                                              I may update our Terms and Conditions
                                              from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
